      <h1>Beginnings</h1>
      <p>
        Minimalism is an art movement that emerged in New York in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
        Minimalist artists wanted to renounce the recent art that they felt had become stale and academic.
        This led them to remove metaphors and expression from their art and create objects that didn't
        look like fine art.

      <h1>Definition</h1>
      <p>
        Minimalist art is characterized by the idea that art should not be an imitation of something else,
        but should be its own reality. Usually we think of art as a representation of something else, whether
        that is something physically in the world or a feeling or emotion. With minimalism, however, there is
        no attempt to represent something else. The artist only wants the viewer to see and think of what is
        in front of them. Frank Stella, a famous minimalist painter, once described this as, "What you see is
        what you see."

      <h1>End</h1>
      <p>
        While the minimalist art movement has not entirely disappeared, it's popularity has definitely decreased.
        This decrease in popularity began in the late 1970s when people started to criticize minimalist art for
        its lack of emotional depth and its detachment from reality. This led to people shifting towards "postminimalism",
        which was a movement where people made more dynamic and expressive forms of art. Although most artists have
        gone away from the traditional minimalist style, the minimalist movement set the stage for more artistic expression
        in modern culture. The legacy of minimalism continues today.
