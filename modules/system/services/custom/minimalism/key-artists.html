      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Many artists contributed to the development of Minimalism. This page highlights three
        important figures. The goal is not to list every artist, but to show some of the most
        influential minimalist artists.

        Frank Stella is known as the artist who inaugurated the period of minimalism.
        His "Black Paintings" were shown in the Museum of Modern Art's Sixteen Americans exhibit in 1959.
        These paintings rejected expressive painting and instead focused on clean lines, repeated patterns,
        and flat, uniform color. His approach influenced many artists who followed, and his early works
        are still some of the most recognizable examples of minimalism.

      <div class="artist-name">Donald Judd</div>
      <div class="artist-meta">American artist • 1928-1994</div>

      <figure class="art-piece">

      </figure>

      <p>
        Donald Judd was a leading figure in minimalism. He created large, machine-finished
        geometric structures. He wanted to create a style that was not decorative or figurative.
        He favored clean lines, sharp angles, and industrial materials. His artworks focused
        on the object itself and its relationship to the space around it. Judd's approach
        became a major influence on minimalist sculpture and installation art.

    <section class="artist">
      <div class="artist-name">Anne Truitt</div>
      <div class="artist-meta">American artist • 1921-2004</div>

      <figure class="art-piece">
        <img src="StoneSouth3.jpg" alt="Anne Truitt's Stone South 3" class="gallery-img">
        <figcaption class="caption">Anne Truitt, Stone South 3, 1974</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        Anne Truitt had the first identifiably minimalist show in 1963 at André Emmerich's gallery.
        Her work drew attention because she combined simple geometric forms with smooth,
        carefully applied layers of color. Even though her sculptures shared qualities with
        Minimalism, she developed her style independently from other minimalist artists. Her
        1963 exhibition is now seen as an important early moment in the development of minimalist art.
