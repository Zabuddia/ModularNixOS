      <h1>Project Purpose</h1>
      <p>
        I created this website to introduce people to the minimalist art movement and to share what I
        learned through my research. Each page explains major ideas, artists, and styles, and the
        backgrounds are digital designs I made based on the minimalist works I studied. The goal is to
        present the main concepts of minimalism in a simple, clear way while visually reflecting the
        movement's style.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Choices</h2>
      <p>The overall design of the website follows minimalist principles:</p>
      <ul class="simple">
        <li>Clean, uncluttered layouts with plenty of open space.</li>
        <li>A limited color palette inspired by minimalist painting.</li>
        <li>Simple typography and straightforward page structure.</li>
        <li>Background art based on works and styles by artists such as Stella, Kelly, Judd, and Truitt.</li>
        <li>A small set of focused pages with no unnecessary visual elements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These choices reflect key themes in minimalist art, including clarity, reduction, geometry, repetition,
        and an emphasis on color and space.
